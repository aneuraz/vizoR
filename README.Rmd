# vizoR

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of vizoR is to provide helper functions to help designing better visualizations in R. 

## Installation

This package is under active developpement. You can install it from github: 

``` r
devtools::install_github("aneuraz/vizoR")
```

## Example

Retrieving a color palette from color-hex.com (by number)

```{r example}
library(vizoR)

pal <- color_hex_palette_from_number(5361)
pal
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
